You are tasked with generating Playwright tests based on the provided script. The tests should cover the following scenarios:

1. Verify that the script successfully navigates to the Playwright website.
2. Ensure that the script clicks the 'Docs' link and waits for the docs page to load.
3. Check that the title of the docs page is as expected.
4. Confirm that a screenshot is taken of the docs page.

Each test should include setup and teardown steps, and should be written in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
