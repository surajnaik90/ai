# AI Reference Repository

This repository is a comprehensive resource for understanding and experimenting with different Artificial Intelligence (AI) use cases, agent architectures, Model Context Protocols (MCPs), and Multi Component Pipelines (MCPipelines). Use this as a reference for learning, prototyping, and building robust AI systems.

---

## 📚 Repository Purpose

- **Reference Hub:** Curated examples of common and advanced AI use cases, agents, and system design patterns.
- **Educational Resource:** Well-documented implementations for learning about AI agents, Model Context Protocols, and Multi Component Pipelines.
- **Experimentation Platform:** Code samples and templates for prototyping your own AI projects.

## ✨ Key Concepts

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized approach for structuring and exchanging context (inputs, history, metadata, results) between different AI models, agents, and pipeline components. It ensures interoperability, modularity, and ease of integration when building multi-agent or multi-component systems.

- **Purpose:**  
  Enable seamless communication and context sharing between various AI components.
- **Features:**  
  - Standardized context format for input, output, and intermediate states  
  - Support for chaining models, agents, and processors  
  - Extensible metadata for custom tasks and logging  
  - Facilitates debugging and tracing in complex workflows

### Multi Component Pipeline (MCPipeline)

A **Multi Component Pipeline** (MCPipeline) is an architectural pattern that combines multiple AI components (like data preprocessors, models, agents, or evaluators) into a cohesive pipeline to solve complex tasks.

- **Examples:**  
  - Data preprocessing → Model inference → Post-processing  
  - Document analysis: OCR → Language Model → Summarization  
  - Multi-agent chat: User → Intent classifier → Task agent → Response generator

- **Advantages:**  
  - Modularity and reusability  
  - Easy experimentation with different pipeline components  
  - Clear separation of concerns  
  - Improved traceability and debugging
