## Technical Notes

1. **API Endpoints**
   - GET `/api/products` with query parameters for filtering and pagination
   - Response includes:
     - Product data array
     - Pagination metadata (total items, pages, current page)
     - Filter metadata (available categories, suppliers)

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Initial page load under 2 seconds
   - Filter application response under 1 second
   - Handle catalogues with up to 10,000 products efficiently

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache filter metadata (categories, suppliers) to reduce API calls
   - Consider client-side caching for recently viewed pages

4. **Error Handling**
   - Display user-friendly error messages for API failures
   - Implement retry mechanism for transient errors
   - Log detailed errors on server for troubleshooting

## Testing Requirements

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verify all filters work correctly independently and in combination
   - Test sorting by each column in ascending and descending order
   - Confirm pagination works with various page sizes
   - Validate export functionality produces correct data in all formats

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test response times with simulated large product catalog (5,000+ products)
   - Verify memory usage remains stable during extended browsing sessions

3. **Usability Testing**
   - Confirm the interface is intuitive for users with varying technical skills
   - Test the responsive behavior across different screen sizes

4. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## Dependencies
- Product data model must be finalized
- Default supplier relationship must be established
- Inventory level calculation logic must be implemented

## Notes and Additional Considerations
- Consider adding a "favorites" or "frequently accessed products" section
- Future enhancement: Add product image thumbnails to the list view
- Analytics opportunity: Track most frequently viewed products for insights
- Accessibility: Ensure the table is navigable via keyboard and screen readers
