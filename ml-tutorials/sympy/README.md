# SymPy Capabilities - Quick Highlights

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. Here are two key capabilities:

1. **Symbolic Differentiation**
   - Calculate derivatives of mathematical functions symbolically (e.g., d/dx of x²)
   - Useful for calculus, optimization, and machine learning

2. **Symbolic Algebra**
   - Define and manipulate mathematical expressions with variables
   - Perform algebraic operations like simplification, expansion, and solving equations

Example: The script `calculate-derivative.py` demonstrates how to compute the derivative of J(W) = W² with respect to W using SymPy.
