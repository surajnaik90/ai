# Basic Science Concepts, Unit of measurements

## Rate
**How fast something happens or changes compare to something else over time**

## Voltage
**Force requried to push electrons from one end to another end.**
- Voltage = Current * Resistance

## Current (rate)
**Flow rate of electric charge (electrons)**
- Current = Charges [Q] / time

## Power (rate)
**The rate at which energy is used or amount of work done per second**
- Power = Voltage * Current

## Energy
**Total amount of work done over time.**
- Energy = Power * time

### Conveyor belt analogy [Objects - Luggage or Boxes move on the belt]

- The **boxes** represent electric charges (**electrons**)
- **Voltage** = The energy required to **push** these boxes.
- **Current** = **Flow rate** - Boxes moved per second
- **Power** = **Total** amount of **energy** **used** to move **all** the **boxes per second**.


## Unit of Measurement

- 1kWh = 1000Wh = Amount of energy consumed per hour = 1 unit of electricity
- 1kWh = 3.6 million joules [SI Unit - International System of Units]

### Example for remembering electricity

- **30W fan running for 10hr = 300Wh = 0.3KWh = 0.3 unit**
- So 3 fans running for whole night (10hrs) would be approximate 1 unit
